The following program is a replication of the game LUNAR LANDER.



[BEFORE YOU BEGIN]
This program makes use of the pygame module and also a downloaded font called Sebastian Gothic NBT.
Make sure that the pygame module is installed on your computer, and install the font file 
included in the zip (SG_0.ttf). 



[STARTING UP THE PROGRAM]
Run the LunarLander.py file. An input prompt should appear on the console, asking for the 
name of a planet (or moon). Type a planet (or moon) name--it is case insensitive--and press enter.
This will bring up a graphics window with the game, with the gravity of the selected planet loaded.

Click anywhere on the start screen to begin the game. 



[CONTROLS]
-Tap or hold down the left and right arrow keys to rotate the spaceship in either direction.
Note that the spaceship will not rotate beyond 180 degrees (like in the game).

-Tap or hold down the up arrow key to apply thrust. (There is no thrust indication graphically,
but you will notice the ship slowing down/speeding up in the respective direction)



[HOW TO WIN]
-The goal of this game is to safely land on the surface of the planet. This is achieved by landing
at a horizontal AND vertical speed of less than 10, and landing exactly at a 90 degree angle on
the surface. 
-Every time you make a safe landing, you earn 100 points, and the game will replay after a short 
congratulatory message. Your score will continue to compile until you run out of fuel or make a 
crash landing. 
-The objective is to land safely as many times as possible with the limited amount of fuel, thus 
gaining the most points.
